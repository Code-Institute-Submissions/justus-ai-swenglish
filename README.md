### levels area.
 in this area i  decided to divide the wwebsite into three levels.
 * the beginner level
 * middle level 
 * sentences.
 Inintially i had it at hard level but then i realised the word "hard level might intimidate som students into not trying it.
 all the above levels are represented by a button that you can click and come into the game at that level .
 I chose an area of questions that are easy to use for daily repetition to make the bginners stage managable.as shown below under the questions area
##question area,
This format is similar to the love maths format because i could see the benefit of having all the features in one page.
 :the direct feed back is rewarding for te kids .This is especially attractive to children who would appreciate direct feedback asit is in many games .
The game  is divided  into three different levels.

##changes
after a while i realsieed for the age group i am targeting(4-6)using sentences will be much harder than if they increased their diction in English. So i eventually removed the sentences as a challenge 
in  the javascript . i had yhe following funtions that i wanted to run:
1. function runGame() { }
2. function checkAnswer() { }
3. funtion calculateCorrectAnswer () { }
4. function incrementScore() { }
5. function incrementWrongAnswer() {}
 6.function displayBeginnerQuestions() { }
 7.function displayMediumQuestions() {}
 8. function displayMoreQuestions() {}
