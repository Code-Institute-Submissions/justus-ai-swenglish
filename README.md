### questions area.
 
 
my initial format is similar to the love maths format because i could see the benefit of having all the features in one page.also i watched some videos done by #QuizApp #WDS #JavaScript on the visual funtionality of color coded screen ie green for correct and red for wrong.
 :the direct feed back is rewarding for the kids .This is especially attractive to children who would appreciate direct feedback as is the case in the popular games .
 the questions will have four choices to choose from  to deduce the correct answer.
 hue feature was also fundermental feature that i used to show a grey color when the questions have not been clicked on courtesy of [Link] https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-control-hue-lights-with-javascript/
 ## difficulties with the code
 1. i was able to achieve the hue for the neutral color but had trouble getting the hue for when the answer is worn and correct.So ater speaking to student care , i ws abe to figure out that i had t declare enter the background color each time i was wrting the code on css. the ::root was not enough on its own to run the background colors as was shown on the youtube video [Link]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k
 #### shuffled questions
 i put in a shuffle questions funtion so that thegame always starts witha a different question. credit to [Link]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k
### controls area
start button and the next button(still considering qhther or not it is bad idea to show the next button).

##changes
after a while i realsieed for the age group i am targeting(4-6)using sentences will be much harder than if they increased their diction in English. So i eventually removed the sentences as a challenge 
in  the javascript . i had yhe following funtions that i wanted to run:
1. function runGame() { }
2. function checkAnswer() { }
3. funtion calculateCorrectAnswer () { }
4. function incrementScore() { }
5. function incrementWrongAnswer() {}
 6.function displayBeginnerQuestions() { }
 7.function displayMediumQuestions() {}
 8. function displayMoreQuestions() {}
